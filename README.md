# basic-chess
Firstly, I created a ChessBoard class for creating a board; a ChessPiece class which is a super class for every chesspiece subclass; then 6 classes,namely King, Queen, Rook, Knight, Pawn and bishop, 5 creating different chess piece objects; and 3 class for exceptions; and one initial class just for empty spaces, which are also objects,  on the board.  
I created a 2D array of type ChessBoard, and then initialized it with object of type initial, which is a subclass of ChessPiece class. And then
initial the board with different chess pieces. And in the driver class, I used while loop to read the file, and use if statement to detect the length of each array that was converted by each line on the file. If the length is 3, it's for initializing the board; otherwise, if length is 5 is for another move on board. Every chess piece subclass has if statement to determine if this move is legal or not. If it's not a legal move then return value according to deferent exceptions; otherwise, add the move.
To build up the program, I actually played 10 time chess game to understand the mechanism inside. To be honest, I never thought chess would be that interesting.
